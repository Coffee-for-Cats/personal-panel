# Front-End
Hosted in vercel, this is the front-end of my web project.
I am using vue.js for the first time and rendering everything in the front-end with async components.

## Hosting & More
There is a project in my github named 'personal-panel-api', check it out.
Hosted in Azure, using MSSQL as a database; the api is completely public, you may be able to host any json by making a simple fetch request.

## Elements
Today, only Paragraphs and primary Titles are supported.

## Project Setup
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```
