# front-end
This is the front-end of my web project!
I am using vue.js for the first time and rendering everything in the front-end with async components.

## API interface {}
- component: codename for the component.
- content: { -> passed for the component as a prop.
  text: inner text
}
- pos: {x, y} -> positions x: 1-4, y: 1.. as grid position.

## Project Setup
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```
